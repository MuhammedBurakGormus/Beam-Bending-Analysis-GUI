# Beam-Bending-Analysis-GUI
The MATLAB GUI allows the analysis of beam structures using Finite Element Method.

The GUI is named as BeamStructureAnalysisFEM.p; and the other files are needed for running the GUI. 

The manual is named as Beam_Analysis_Manual.pdf in which the basic instructions related to GUI are given. 

The logic behind the code can be found in Slide-BeamBendingAnalysisUsinFEM.key in which the stiffness matrix and other concepts are discussed.

The explanatory videos links for the concept&GUI as follows:
