# Beam Bending Analyis MATLAB Application 

The MATLAB GUI allows the analysis of beam structures using Finite Element Method (1D) such that:
- The deflection values throughout the length of a beam
- The elastic curve for each beam element
- Reaction forces at the supports can found.
  
---  

The GUI is named as BeamStructureAnalysisFEM.p; and the other files are needed for running the GUI. 
The manual is named as Beam_Analysis_Manual.pdf in which the basic instructions related to GUI are given.
